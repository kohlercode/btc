# KOHLERCODE LLC - Identity & Standards

## 1. Company Profile
- **Entity:** KOHLERCODE LLC (US-based)
- **Founder:** Simon Köhler
- **Focus:** High-end TYPO3 development, Shopify Themes, and AI Automation.

## 2. Branding & Documentation
- **Author Tag:** Always use `Author: Simon Köhler (KOHLERCODE LLC)` in file headers.
- **Language:** Code comments should be in English, but UI translations (t-filters) should prioritize German/Spanish/English as required by the project.

## 3. Workflow Preferences
- **Architecture:** Prioritize modularity and "Agent-friendly" code (clear naming, no "magic" numbers).
- **Communication:** Be concise. If a task involves a cost-intensive API (like ElevenLabs or HeyGen), warn the user before generating the execution script.
